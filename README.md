Employee Tracker

Wrote Node App to Connect to Local database with Loaded shcema and preloaded test data.

The Application will present the user with options to;

? What would you like to do? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ View All Department 
  View All Roles 
  View All Employees 
  Add A Department 
  Add A Role 
  Add An Employee 
  Update An Employee Role 
  Logout

The view all options will dispay all rows of current data listed under the corresponding table name select.

The Add Options will let add new input to the corresponding selected table name.

The Logout Option will terminate the app and log out the user from the databse.

Ran into issue with node where it would not connnect to local database. Reviewed issue with T.A. could not determinse cause. Was advised to submit as is.
